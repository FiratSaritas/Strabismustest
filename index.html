            <h2>What is Strabismus?</h2>
            <p>Strabismus is a vision condition in which a person's eyes do not align properly with one another. While one eye looks at an object, the other eye may turn inward, outward, upward, or downward. This misalignment can be constant or it may come and go. If left untreated, particularly in children, it can lead to amblyopia (lazy eye) and a permanent loss of vision in the turned eye.</p>
            <p>It's a common condition, affecting an estimated 2-4% of the population. The cause often relates to a problem with the eye muscles, the nerves that control them, or the vision center in the brain. Learn more on our <a href="about.html">About Strabismus</a> page.</p>

            <h2>Why Early Detection Matters</h2>
            <p>The brain and eyes must work together for clear, single vision. When eyes are misaligned, the brain receives two different images. To avoid double vision, a child's brain may learn to ignore the image from the misaligned eye. This lack of use can cause the vision in that eye to weaken, a condition known as amblyopia or "lazy eye."</p>
            <p>Early detection and professional treatment are the best ways to prevent long-term vision problems. Our online test can serve as a first step in identifying potential issues, but it is not a substitute for a comprehensive exam by an ophthalmologist or optometrist.</p>

             <h2>How Our Test Can Help</h2>
            <p>Our interactive strabismus test is designed to help you check for potential eye misalignments from the comfort of your home. It uses a well-known method involving colored filters (like red/cyan 3D glasses) to isolate what each eye sees. By tracking how you perceive objects on the screen, the test can give a preliminary indication of how well your eyes are working together.</p>
