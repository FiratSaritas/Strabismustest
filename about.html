            <h1>All About Strabismus (Crossed Eyes)</h1>

            <h2>What Exactly is Strabismus?</h2>
            <p>Strabismus is a medical condition where the eyes are misaligned and point in different directions. This misalignment is caused by a lack of coordination between the six muscles that control eye movement. While one eye looks directly at an object, the other may be turned inward (esotropia), outward (exotropia), upward (hypertropia), or downward (hypotropia). This can be a constant condition or it can be intermittent, appearing only when a person is tired, ill, or has done a lot of reading.</p>

            <h2>Common Causes of Strabismus</h2>
            <p>Strabismus can be congenital (present at birth) or acquired later in life. There is no single cause, but it often stems from issues with the neuromuscular control of eye movement. Key factors include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> A family history of strabismus increases the risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Refractive Errors:</strong> Significant farsightedness (hyperopia) can cause the eyes to turn inward as they work harder to focus.</li>
                <li><strong>Medical Conditions:</strong> Conditions like Cerebral Palsy, Down syndrome, or hydrocephalus can be associated with strabismus.</li>
                <li><strong>Nerve or Muscle Issues:</strong> Damage to the cranial nerves that control eye muscles due to head trauma, stroke, or tumors can lead to strabismus in adults.</li>
                <li><strong>Idiopathic:</strong> In many cases, especially in children, the exact cause is unknown.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Recognizing the Symptoms</h2>
            <p>The most apparent sign is a visible misalignment of the eyes. However, other symptoms can also indicate the presence of strabismus:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Squinting or frequently closing one eye, especially in bright sunlight.</li>
                <li>Tilting or turning the head to view objects.</li>
                <li>Faulty depth perception, leading to clumsiness.</li>
                <li>Double vision (diplopia), which is more common in adults who develop strabismus.</li>
                <li>Eye strain and headaches.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you or your child exhibit any of these symptoms, it is crucial to schedule an examination with an eye care professional. Early and accurate diagnosis is the first step toward effective treatment.</p>
